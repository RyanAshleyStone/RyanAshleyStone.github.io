Name: Beginnings
This project is the very beginning. 

The purpose is serves is to track my progress as I work my way through MIT XPro Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. I hope to sharpen my skills enough to be a developer when the course is done. 

Usage: Use with your own discretion. I hope to learn and flourish in this enrivonment, but I am nervous putting myself out there. I hope that each day I learn 1% more than I knew the last, and sharpen my skills. 

Support: If you have any questions please email me at ryan.ashley.stone@gmail.com

Roadmap: 
Hoping to grow this page and be proud of how far I've come.
